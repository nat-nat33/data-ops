I am currently enrolled at UH Manoa, pursuing an MBA degree on a part-time basis. I was referred to you by the University's GBSA graduate leadership committee.I also work full-time at Anthology Marketing Group, working in Digital Advertising and Web Development.My direct responsibilities are client account management, although I would like to grow into a more technical, hands-on role in the future. I believe that DevLeague can help me in this regard.My initial questions:-The Part-time program seems to be the most feasible option for me. Could you go into what kind of time I would need to invest in the program? How flexible is the schedule?-Do you have any partnerships with UH Manoa related to tuition/credit forgiveness?-What is the timeframe of the course (start/end dates)?Thank you for your time, and I look forward to getting a dialogue going.-Nick",,,Vic Lee,0,8/18/17,,,8/16/17,,,,,,,,,http://www.devleague.com/funding,http://www.devleague.com/,,,hi,8/16/17,,,Lead,,8/18/17,,DevLeague | Join The Movement.

I was in the education sector, teaching 8th grade Algebra to under-served youth. Due to some tough life circumstances, I had to change gears, but in addition to being a service worker, I am also an artist, in love with both music and poetry. I am teaching myself guitar via the internet, as well as learning how to write songs. What fascinates me about coding is how it is a completely different medium for creating and requires you to learn a different language, but much like any instrument, once you learn how to speak it, you can pretty much create everything. I love the arts, and what I want to do is create something that gives others the opportunity to create things, and put them out into the world, much like soundcloud or Youtube, where filmmakers and musicians are allowed to create their own work and put it out into the world, giving artists control over their own work.

I am very interested in statistical analysis in classroom performance by both the Instructors and learners and would be keen in learning and applying big data to the perceived and tested outcomes if the opportunity arises in the future.

I am very interested in becoming a software engineer, but have found self-teaching an ineffective and inefficient pedagogical framework. I am an independent contractor with The Shidler Group, ""programming"" VBA to enhance the functionality of spreadsheets on which they rely to deploy real estate investment capital. I have a degree in Finance, and prior to the Big Move, I led a team of appraisers in the commercial division of the tax assessor's office. In my spare time I'm addicted to software engineering podcasts, reading droll technical books (no, the 4th ed. of the SQL standard, circa 1996, hasn't aged well!), and voraciously consuming as much information as I can reasonably process. I'm exploring my options, not yet ready to enroll in anything, but hoping to determine whether the bootcamp method is a good fit for my learning style. Mahalo for your time.

I've been learning with Code Academy and Free Code Camp and feel comfortable and interested enough that I can see myself having a career in this field. I've also read up a lot on bootcamps and came across DevLeague in my research. I'm super excited to get started and see how much I can grow and learn in such a short period of time. I live in Virginia at the moment with my girlfriend, a roommate, and our two dogs, just the thought of leaving them saddens me but I am excited to jump start into a career! On a more personal note, I was diagnosed with brain cancer as a child, and growing up I was in a physically and emotionally abusive household. It wasn't until college that I broke away and took my life into my own hands. After overcoming so many obstacles throughout my life, I feel that I can take on anything, which is why I feel so confidently in my ability to successfully take on DevLeague's rigorous course.",,,,,,,,,,,7/25/17,,7/25/17,7/25/17,,,,,,,,,,jtrinh619@gmail.com,,,,,,,,Tier 1,,novice,,,,

However as you can imagine thereafter finding a career in the field or even teaching where I live was very problematic. I ended-up working for an awesome local fin-tech startup as a junior project manager. During my work at that company, I was exposed to the working routine of the dev team and ever since wanted to make the transition from non-technical role into a development one. I have been studying on my own on and off, but I truly thrive with some guidance and structured studying with no distractions. So I believe that joining a bootcamp is what will enable me to bring my skills to the next level.",Canada,,,,,,,,,,10/8/17,,10/8/17,,,,,,,,,,,ekasian@outlook.com,,,,,,,,Tier 1,,novice,,,,

Education is more valued and more necessary that ever before. The bottom line is that today ALL high school graduates need to be prepared for some post secondary education and/or training if they are to have options and opportunities in the job market.What is Career Ready-In today_Ñés economy, a _ÑÒcareer_Ñ is not just a job. A career provides a family-sustaining wage and pathways to advancement and requires post secondary training or education. A job may be obtained with only a high school diploma, but offers no guarantee of advancement or mobility. Being ready for a career means that a high school graduate has the English, and mathematics knowledge and skills needed to qualify for and succeed in the post secondary job training and/or education necessary for their chosen career (i.e. technical/vocational program, community college, apprenticeship or significant on-the-job training). What is College Ready-College today means much more than just pursuing a four- year degree at a university. Being _ÑÒcollege ready_Ñ means being prepared for any post secondary education or training experience, including study at two- and four year institutions leading to a post secondary credential (i.e. a certificate, license, Associates or Bachelor_Ñés degree). Being ready for college means that a high school graduate has the English and mathematics knowledge and skills necessary to qualify for and succeed in entry level, credit-bearing college courses without the need for remedial course work.How do we plan to achieve this?ë_ Below are some of the ideas we would like to implement in our academy structure. ë_Guest Speakers / Career Daysë_- We would like the support of your organization in providing speakers for JCHS in the areas in which you hire for employment.ë_ Such areas would be in Business & Marketing, Health Occupations, Culinary, and other opportunities.ë_ Speakers would discuss the requirements for the position, education needed, job demands and how can students be better prepared for positions within your organization.Facility Toursë_- We would love to have some of our classes tour your facilities, we feel being able to visually see the workplace offers a student first hand information of the various jobs that are performed within your organization.ë_ Exposure to the variety of career choices available is vital in a students early years so they can somewhat prepare for a career and college choice.ë_ We do understand that most people change jobs numerous times, but the intent is to expose them to what is available.Job Shadowingë_- We would like to possibly pair up some of our students with employees in your organization that students have selected to witness what is done in that specific career.ë_ Possibly see two or three different jobs within their visit.ë_ The time would be arranged with your organization as well as the number of students you feel you could accommodate.ë_ These would be students who have earned the right to attend.ë_ This experience would be valuable in determining their eventual career choice.Internshipsë_- This would be for the best of the best of our Senior students.ë_ We would like to place a student or two within your organization who might best fit your needs for employment.ë_ This will allow them to achieve on the job training and evaluate their current skill set and identify areas in need of improvement.ë_ This internship may also lead to employment for the student and possibly solidify their career choice.ë_ We would work with your management group to decide what would be the best fit and working agreement to support both of our efforts.ë_ We want it to be a win-win for all.Externshipsë_- We would possibly like to have a teacher do a short-term assignment to gain first hand knowledge of the workplace requirements for your organization, so that they can further develop their teaching and curriculum to meet the needs of the workplace and the skills required for the students.Community Service Projectsë_- We would like to have our academy give back to your organization by assisting with community service projects or other areas in which you need help and we can support.ë_ We want our students to be well rounded and these service projects allow them to get out and be a contributing member of our society.ë_ Its not only about what you can do to help us, but what can we do to help you.ë_ We feel this will better prepare our students to be a well-rounded students and provide the characteristics needed to be successful in life.School-Based Enterprise (SBE)ë_- is an entrepreneurial operation in a school setting that provides goods/services to meet the needs of the market. SBEs are managed and operated by students as hands-on learning laboratories that integrate National Curriculum Standards in marketing, finance, hospitality or management.ë_ SBEs provide realistic and practical learning experiences that reinforce classroom instruction. SBEs can sell to consumers through a permanent location, a mobile kiosk or through Internet marketing.ë_Products may include spirit wear, food and beverage items, school supplies, signs and banners and more, while other SBEs provide services such as creative design, advertising sales and more.ë_ Our goal is to eventually build small school-based business opportunities on campus that would be student run.ë_ Students need to learn the day to day tasks with business operations. Scholarshipsë_- I would like to create an opportunity to develop some scholarships for students in our academy in the Business and Natural Resources Pathways.ë_ Still working on the particulars, but working in conjunction with our business partners, I feel we can create a great award system for those students wishing to go above and beyond and excelling in these areas.ë_ Great way to give back to students doing great things.Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns and would like to arrange a time to discuss this potential partnership in detail.ë_ We are willing to make it fit your schedule and needs.ë_ We do not want this to impact your organization in a negative way.ë_ We are willing to develop it to meet the needs of your organization.Thank you in advance for your willingness to consider a business partnership with the James Campbell High School.ë_ Together, we can make great things happen.My Dreamë_- My Pathë_- My StoryI look forward to discussing this in further detail when time permits,Shayne Greenland808-253-8510",,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.devleague.com/contact,https://www.devleague.com/,,,hi,10/22/17,,,Lead,,,,DevLeague | Join The Movement.

I have a desire to see people in my community take part in the coding revolution. I believe the Cyber Security Professional tract will be a good fit for myself, and in the future i would like to teach others to solve problems with code. In the area of cyber security i have listened to a podcast called ""Risky Business"" a podcast that features news and in-depth commentary from security industry luminaries. It is Australian based and has given me a peak at some of the world wide security vulnerabilities cyber security professionals face each week. Here is an example : https://risky.biz/soapbox7/ Unfortunately I have missed the cyber prep course date and i would like to know of any resource material you would recommend i study should i be accepted in the Cyber Security Professional course.

I have a degree in business management that I put to use trying to launch sustainable businesses here in my hometown of El Paso, Texas. Recently, I was the first place winner of the Space Race Challenge (space-race.org), an international start-up competition to commercialize NASA patents. The patent I chose, and won with, was for an advanced coating that galvanically protects embedded steel rebar from corrosion. I chose this technology because infrastructure in our country is crumbling and needs to preserved due to lack of new investment. I am passionate about solving real problems facing society and corrosion is one of those problems that will never go away. It was all for naught as, in the end, my investor went back on their promises and I had to walk away from the project or continue with low pay and zero share of the company I founded. It was an amazing experience but it was also sharp lesson. I want to take that experience, learn everything I possibly can about cybersecurity/infosec, and eventually launch my own firm after I've acquired some experience working for real players in the industry. From my research, Devleague looks to be an amazing, immersive experience for those looking for such a career boost. I believe I am a great fit for the devleague program as I love technology, I thrive in team-oriented environments, I am a quick study, and I am passionate about making a positive impact on the issues the world is facing. While my experience with coding/infosec is limited, I have contacted cybersecurity professionals who have helped advise me on the material I should learn first. I am very interested in taking the prep course, however the cybersecurity track begins halfway through the course. Maybe we can work something out..? Thank you for your time and I hope to hear back! -Olmer Brooker",,,,,,,,,,,10/12/17,,10/12/17,,,,,,,,,,,okbrooker12@gmail.com,,,,,,,,Tier 1,,none,,,,

I also did a Summer research program in Computer Science helping secondary school teachers learn to code using a basic program called Alice. Since graduating, I've mostly been volunteering at the hospital and applying to grad programs. However in my second year out of school I got ill for two years.

I've recently gotten into cryptocurrency and fin-tech. I'm passionate about crypto-currency and decentralized apps. I'm an active investor in bitcoin and ethereum along with other decentralized currencies. I believe that it has the potential to impact the world in a positive way by redistributing power to normal citizens. My major is EE but recently I've been getting distracted, too distracted.

I have no background in IT and I am currently working as a medical lab tech.It is to my understanding from information on the website that at the completion of the program, I will receive 3 certifications.  I was wondering how does these certifications stand up against people with degrees in cyber security...does companies value degrees or certifications more if they both have no experience?  Are people commonly known to move up in a company with just certifications and no degree?  Would I be able to get a regular IT job with these certifications?I feel I am too late to apply for the class that starts in September because I would like to do all the prep work since I have no experience in this field.  I was wondering when the next class will be scheduled to start.  Is there a fixed time for the part time schedule on Wed, Thurs, and Sat?  I would need to plan out my work schedule to revolve around the class times because I will still need to work full time.Please get back to when you can.  I would like some more information before I commit to this program.

We are currently in the process of developing our new site. As an alumni from a bootcamp myself, I know how hard it is to get a good overview of bootcamps. Hence, I am making it very easy.While, a basic signup on our site is free, the functionality is limited to just getting a ""pin"" on the map. You will not show up in any of the comparisations or any other information. We had a introduction offer for our premium section which is $239 USD for the first year (starting at launch) and includes a free interview and blog post.I am extending this offer to you as we were not able to find you online and I am very interested to get to hear your personal story and programming in the middle east. It would be great to get in touch.

I think that gaining a better understanding of computer programming can help me accomplish that. I do almost everything on my computer. I write, read, listen to music, write music, shop, browse, game, talk, and waste time all on my devices. While some of my mentors and friends have said that too much time spent in front of a screen isn't a good thing, it has gotten me more comfortable with technology, with searching for anything, and even helping me understand how to properly help someone correct a problem based on how much of the problem they understand (be it tech-related, science-related, or just life advice).",,,,,,,,,,,6/20/17,,6/20/17,,,,,,,,,,,nils.gudbran@gmail.com,,,,,,,,Tier 2,,novice,,,,

I have been working at Apple for 5 years now and every 6 months I find myself seeking a new challenge which provided me the opportunity to work in every area of the store in several different positions. Recently I left the store manager position to go part-time to seek out new challenges, started a java-script class on Khan Academy - felt the brain challenge I had been craving, only problem is I learn better with hands-on support vs youtubing everything which led me to DevLeague. I have lived in Hawaii for the past 4 years, transferred with Apple from MN. A software developer career interests me because I love to travel and want to find a career that allows me to travel and work at the same time. When I was most passionate about my career at Apple i usually spent 60 hours a week at work, which leads me to believe that I would be successful in bootcamp style of learning. I go to CrossFit Kuleana - i love the group atmosphere, its an encouraging atmosphere filled with support, good instruction and friendly environment. I volunteer at Hawaii Bicycle League, I absolutely love to bike - i dont own a car. I am passionate about bicycle advocacy and making Hawaii safer for cyclists. I have a good family support for this type of career change, my younger brother is a graphic designer/web developer. My older brother is a web/app developer. Im 32, I like to make pancakes for breakfast, and love to dance!

My name is Levi and I live and work in Honolulu. I have lived in Hawaii for almost two years. Before moving here, I spent eight years in the Coast Guard, living primarily in Jacksonville, Florida. In Jacksonville, I attended the University of North Florida studying public relations. After deciding that I had no interest pursuing a career in PR, I started doing freelance marketing and teaching myself to code. I started with HTML and CSS, and eventually stepped into PHP for Wordpress development. Since then I_Ñéve experimented with SASS, static website generators, and git. Currently, I work in digital marketing at Becker Communications. It's a small PR firm downtown where I spend most of my time on marketing campaigns for locally-based clients. In May, I was fortunate enough to take the Prep Course taught by Vic. Since then, I_Ñéve participated in a couple hackathons, but I'm not currently working on projects where I can get much Javascript practice in. When I_Ñém not working, I like to explore the Hawaii outdoors, play and watch soccer, and listen to podcasts. So, that_Ñés a bit about me. To close, I_Ñéd like to leave you with my answer to the question ""What do I hope to get out of this program?"" My primary goal is to learn. I_Ñéve been very interested in how people make the products and experiences of the internet for a few years now. Ever since I started teaching myself to code, I_Ñéve been fascinated by how things are made. Secondarily, I am motivated by the prospect of starting a new career path. Being able to solve problems and bring creative ideas to life is exciting to me. Thank you, Levi Porter",,,,,,,,,,,10/13/17,,10/13/17,11/28/17,,,,,,,,,,levi@levibrooke.com,,,,,,,,Tier 1,,intermediate ,,,,levibrooke.com

My name is Brandon Fowler. I was born and raised here on O'ahu and after graduating from Roosevelt High School in 2012, I moved up to San Francisco to attend the University of San Francisco. I initially thought I wanted to be a Finance major but during my sophomore year I switched over to a Computer Science major. I recently graduated in may 2016 with a B.S. in computer science. I graduated at the top of my class and I was the only summa cum laude. After graduating I spent the last year fulfilling my travel bug. I traveled all throughout Europe, Japan, Korea, Malaysia and various other countries. Upon returning back from my travels, I found it was very difficult for me to get a job. I couldn't get any internships because most companies require that you be attending school in order to qualify for an internship. I also didn't meet the timeline for a new grad position. And finally I didn't have any experience in order to qualify for a regular developer position. That said, I really think DevLeague would be great for me to improve my coding skills through learning new languages in depth. And I think it will also allow me to have more hands on coding experience as a lot of what I learned in school was theory rather than practical. My main goal is to land a software developer position at one of the bigger tech companies in the bay area or Seattle. I also want to learn as much as I can and hopefully be able to build apps or websites and do some freelance work.",,,,,,,,,,,12/4/17,,12/4/17,12/4/17,,,,,,,,,,bmfowler4@gmail.com,,,,,,,,Tier 1,,junior,,,,

At 28 years old, I am recent graduate of Carnegie Mellon University with a BA in Creative Writing, and I am on a journey of redemption. I see DevLeague as the best way for me to improve my life, and correct the mistakes of my past. I graduated from Punahou School in 2007, and began attending Carnegie Mellon the following fall. For most of my life I had believed I was going to go into the sciences, or engineering. I passed AP Physics and a Java-based AP Computer Science class. But in the summer between my Junior and Senior year of high school, I took a writing class to improve my college application essays. I had the unfortunate pleasure to discover I had a talent for writing, and that I enjoyed the work involved in honing my craft. Despite the fact that I was accepted into the school of Information Systems and the college of Electrical and Computer Engineering, when the time came to choose a college to enroll in at CMU, I chose the highly lucrative major of Creative Writing. Influenced by my hobbies in computer gaming and long nights spent running games of Dungeons and Dragons for my friends, I dreamt of writing stories for game companies like Bioware, Blizzard, Doublefine, and Wizards of the Coast, with a fallback plan of writing for magazines like WIRED or Science until I could achieve such a position. However, when the recession of 2008 hit, the landscape of my dream path was massively altered. Newspapers and Magazines either folded or downsized. Other established writing jobs became much more competitive. Now it was much more likely that as a writer I would have to make a living as a freelancer, selling articles piecemeal with no chance at job security. Then in the winter of that year my grandfather, who had been financially supporting my education, as well as my hanai grandmother who I had known since I was two, passed away. I had already struggled for a long time with anxiety and depression since I was a child; I was the victim of severe bullying (similar to what you might see in the documentary _ÑÉBully_Ñé), which finally caused me to change schools from Iolani to Punahou in 10th grade. Then the emotional blow of never being able to prove myself to my grandfather, and my uncertain professional future, caused me to lose focus and motivation as a writer. My anxiety disorder made even starting major assignments very difficult, and I frequently experienced panic-attacks when writing. I struggled for a few more years, with steadily declining grades, until in 2011 I was suspended from Carnegie Mellon. Because I performed well in my first few semesters at CMU, my GPA didn_Ñét actually require suspension, but when I failed a couple classes my advisors could see my trajectory would not improve without a drastic intervention. I returned home and sought out counseling and medication, and tried enrolling at UH for a semester to prove I could return to CMU. However, I discovered that my anxiety issues had not been resolved, and had the same difficulties in completing work that I did at CMU. I was dejected, and lost all confidence in my abilities as a student. I dropped out of school, and spent the next few years working a variety of jobs. I worked at the Kaimuki YMCA as a counselor; I moved furniture; I was an office assistant; I did inventory and bookkeeping for Nohea Gallery; I spent 7 months as a research assistant doing data entry for the National Center for PTSD; and finally worked as a salesman in the hardware department of Sears Windward Mall for a year and a half, all while continuing with psychological therapy. My time in retail ended up being extremely therapeutic. I am by nature a highly introverted person, and being forced to interact with others, selling a product I had little prior experience with, gave my opportunity to practice managing my anxiety in a day-to-day setting. I was very successful at my job, and was even for a month was the salesman with the highest sales-per-hour in the Hawaii and California region. However, I was still very unhappy with my life situation. The pay was meager compared to the amount of stress and abuse from customers I had to endure. Also, being a high-achiever for most of my youth, I had a hard time accepting my new identity as a college dropout with limited employment potential. In 2016 I re-enrolled at Carnegie Mellon with the goal of completing my degree. It was one of the hardest things I had ever done. Though I had made great improvements, my depression and anxiety never entirely disappeared. However, with hard work, often having to do 2 or 3 all-nighters a week for months at a time, I finally graduated in May of 2017. Though I had limited success as a writer in CMU, receiving a school award and receiving publishing for a creative non-fiction story I had written, I knew I could not endure living as a freelancer, and so began diversifying my abilities. When I returned to CMU I took a drawing class through the CMU school of art, and took a beginner class in Python. When I returned home for the Summer, through personal connections I was offered a job teaching a summer-school class in basic programming with MIT_Ñés SCRATCH to Middle School students at St. Andrew_Ñés Priory. Upon completing the class, I was offered a position to teach the course for the normal school-year at the High School level. However, at this time I don_Ñét feel entirely qualified, and would prefer to improve my programming skills and knowledge in computer science: another reason I chose to apply to DevLeague. I have several friends in the indie gaming industry, and still entertain the dream of working for a game-company. Participating in DevLeague would make me much more employable as a triple-threat with writing, art, and programming skills. Aside from that, being a software engineer would also provide much more financial security than any writing-based work I could get. Should I choose to return to education, completing a DevLeague course would give me the confidence to teach at a higher level. I don_Ñét know if it would be appropriate since I have some prior coding experience, but if it would be helpful I am also interested in taking the upcoming prep-course. I believe that given my life experience and my future aspirations, I am an ideal candidate for DevLeague, and would be a prime example that this training provides access to new and exciting professional avenues that would not otherwise be possible. I look forward to hearing back from you in the near future.",,,,,,,,,,,7/7/17,,7/7/17,12/8/17,,,,,,,,,,jjleung@alumni.cmu.edu,,,,,,,,Tier 1,,,,,,Carnegie Mellon University

I'm Mark and I currently work as an ophthalmic technician for a laser eye surgery center, which is obviously very different from someone in web development. Before jumping into my career in eyes I was unemployed and living on a boat in the Ala Wai Harbor. During this time I attempted to learn some programming at the suggestion of my (computer programming) friend. It started to become a little difficult studying on my own. And then, it became VERY difficult when my bank account started to shrink. I decided to press pause on programming and get back into the groove. This is when I found my job as an ophthalmic technician. I soon moved off the boat and focused my attention on working. After a year or so of work I started looking into freecodecamp (again at the suggestion of the same friend). I go through waves of inspiration and frustration, which I'm told is quite common while programming. The biggest difficulty I find is not having someone to ask questions to. I believe I work best with classmates in a structured setting. My colleague suggested to look into Dev League as she is currently enrolled herself. I'm hopeful that Dev League will give me the final push I need to learn enough web development for me to shift careers!",,,,,,,8/4/17,,hawaii,7/23/17,6/24/17,,6/24/17,9/21/17,,ophthalmic technician,,,https://www.google.com/,http://www.devleague.com/,,,41,markwuu@gmail.com,,,,pacific_slash_honolulu,,united states,,Closed Won,,novice,,,,

I'm Audrey, I moved to Hawaii last year from Madison, WI, where I attended UW-Madison. I started out my degree in Biomedical Engineering with a certificate in CS, as I did a little tinkering around in HTML/CSS and Lua in high school. However, I found the pacing of the classes to be a bit much and the rest of my classmates seemed way more experienced than I. So after jumping around to Fashion and Textile design for a year, I finally settled on Creative Writing and Studio Art :) Here in Hawaii I work for Yoga Ed. as their production manager where I do all production for videos, from pre to post. I also teach yoga part-time. I just discovered your programs through Instagram and am very interested in trying to learn to code again. I would like to expand my skillset, learn a lot, and hopefully return to something that fascinated me when I was younger.",,,,,,,,,,,7/31/17,,7/31/17,11/21/17,,,,,,,,,,audreybrown94@gmail.com,Yoga Ed,,,,,,,Tier 1,,novice,,,,

After high school I went to Honolulu Community College for Refrigeration and Air Conditioning but about halfway through that I realized that it wasn't for me. Since then I've been working various restaurant jobs for quick cash while I ""figure out"" what it is that I want to with my life. After many career/ personality test online I noticed a trend of careers having to do with computers, never being tech savvy in the past, I never put much consideration into this and continued my search striving for something creative. That is until around December of 2016, when I finally gave in and did actual research into what a programming career would be. In this research I found that not only can I be creative in this field but that it is absolutely necessary; from designing a page to problem solving a broken code , creativity is key. Soon after I started an online course called Free Code Camp and fell in love with it. The experience was amazing and I eventually got my Front End Development Certificate but found myself struggling as it eventually turns into a self teaching program with project after project without instruction on how to complete said projects. I was left on my own to find answers online, but felt as if I never fully understood why certain things were or were not working. I realized that if I want to be successful I would need a more hands on approach. This is when I found out about bootcamps and was ecstatic that not only was there one in Hawaii where I live, but that it's one of the best in the country! So here I am now hoping to become a part of the Dev League alumni with the knowledge to better myself and start a career that will make me truly happy.",,,,,,,,,,,11/13/17,,11/13/17,12/7/17,,,,,,,,,,nicnhines3@gmail.com,,,,,,,,Tier 1,,novice,,,,

With a background in construction project and operations management, I'm looking for a more creative and progressive industry to pursue. The first opportunity I took after university led me to Northern Alberta, Canada to work on a large industry oil project. After that, my journey led me through Canada, Indonesia, Guam, and now Hawai'i, with experience in industrial, municipal, hospitality, commercial and residential construction. SO! I was recently laid off from my solar position here in Oahu and this time has given me space to really meditate on what I'd like to do in my life. Having always been process-oriented, naturally curious, and driven by data and information, I feel tech would be a great pivot for me as it celebrates those skills and values. Plus, I've always wanted to nerd out more than I allowed myself, and construction is definitely not a passion of mine. Eventually, I would love to start up my own business and/or create SOMETHING of my own, or even have the freedom to work remotely. I'm curious to find out more about the Data Analyst track as well.

Learn to Code in Hawaii!: Contact Form,,,," So, basically I_Ñéve been trying to learn coding off and on starting around 2003. I took an intro to Python, started falling behind and ended up dropping it. The same thing happened in 2006 with an intro to Java. Coding always felt like an unattainable dream because as difficult of a time I was having in those classes I had to retake algebra twice and ended up just getting around the math requirement all together by taking an intro to logic. ( Interestingly enough I got a 100% in that class and had a great time solving logic proofs) Back then the only way I thought people could become programmers was though a traditional CS degree and with my math skills I knew that wasn_Ñét happening so I compromised. I went and made up my own degree in Assistive Technology because I knew how much AT helped me with my own learning disabilities. It would be a job that let me use technology and help people at the same time what could be better? Well, then the economy kinda tanked right after I finished my BA so I thought I_Ñéd go hide out in grad school while waiting for things to improve. That lead me to getting an M.Ed in special education with a focus on Assistive Technology. That ended up being one of those it seemed like a good idea at the time type of situations. It turns out being hyper specialized which, I thought was going to be a good thing actually wasn_Ñét. I tried getting into the wider AT field but because it is so specialized the amount of jobs on the market just weren_Ñét there and forward thinking tech companies around here who would understand my vision weren't exactly plentiful. So I tried moving to CA for awhile. I thought a bigger state would make a difference but it didn_Ñét end up going well. I was in northern CA because I have family there. I tried to find a company I was a good fit for and came up empty so I thought the bay area might contain the people who understood what I was trying to do with accessibility and technology. I was all setup to spend a year with AmeriCore in a joint project between Google and the Boys and Girls Club of America teaching scratch but was informed I_Ñéd be on my own finding a place to live with a start date less than a month away. Between the crazy rents and tiny stipend I could see the writing on the wall and had to come back to Oahu. Knowing the DOE also did assistive technology and that seeming to be my only other option I tried finding something with them but ended up being slightly misled and ended up being the world_Ñés most overqualified education assistant. Now I_Ñém at a crossroads trying to figure out what to do next. I_Ñéve always wanted to do programming from the very beginning and kept thinking that just wasn_Ñét ever going to be an option. After all this time I_Ñéve come to realize that with the new learning tools available it finally is. I understand this is going to be the most difficult challenge I_Ñéve ever faced but hard work and dedication will make it possible. That_Ñés why I_Ñéve been spending every day between now and the November 12 start date practicing using online coding tools to make sure I have the foundation I need to finish the dev bootcamp successfully.",,,,,,,8/4/17,,hawaii,,7/20/17,,7/20/17,12/8/17,,,,,,,,,15,uhwebmail@gmail.com,,,,pacific_slash_honolulu,,united states,,Closed Won,,,,,,

But I am very comfortable using computers for both office work and at home. My intent is to try the prep course first and see if coding is something that I could be good at. Learning new things is always good. I also know the job outlook for this type of skill is on the rise. And my business degree alone hasn't quite gotten me to where I want to be. A little about me. I'm a big consumer of media (television, movies, podcasts, comic books). Looking forward to the next season of Game of Thrones and the release of Thor: Ragnarok. Thinking about starting my own podcast one day. Haven't come up with a good gimmick for it yet though. I am from Hawaii but most people think I'm from the mainland when they meet me. Probably because I never really picked up pidgin. Fun fact: I had perfect attendance for all four years of high school (never late, never absent).
